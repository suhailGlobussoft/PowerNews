        "description": "External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday took a critical view of the United Nations, saying it was \"like an old company\", not entirely keeping up with the market but occupying the space. During an interaction at the Kautilya Economic Conclave here, he also said that two very serious conflicts are going on in the world. \"And where is the UN on them, essentially a bystander,\" the minister said. In response to a query on the possible outcome of the US elections, he said the US actually has \"made a shift\", geopolitically and in its economic outlook, and irrespective of the outcomes in November, many of these trends will \"intensify\" in the days to come. Jaishankar took part in the interactive session on 'India and the Globe' and spoke of India's role and challenges amid changing global dynamics.    113983477\"So, we are both a lifting tide and a bit of paradoxical one, a ballast as well,\" Jaishankar said as he enumerated some of the steps India has taken to help other countries, including its neighbours such as Sri Lanka. Asked about his upcoming visit to Pakistan to attend a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), he again sought to rule out any bilateral talks with his Pakistani counterpart. \"I am going there for a certain job, a certain responsibility. And, I take my responsibilities seriously. So, I am going there to represent India at the SCO meeting, and that is what I am going to do,\" Jaishankar said. At an event on Saturday, the external affairs minister said that he was going to Islamabad for a \"multilateral event\" and not to discuss India-Pakistan relations. In his response to a query on the United Nations' role amid the changing global scenario, he took a rather critical view of the world body that was born in 1945 after the Second World War. Initially, it had 50 countries, which has grown over these years to nearly four times. \"The UN is in a way like an old company, not entirely keeping up with the market, but occupying the space. And, when it's behind times, in this world you have start-ups and innovations, so different people start doing their own things,\" Jaishankar said. \"So, what you have today is that yes you have a UN at the end, however suboptimal in functioning, it is still the only multilateral game in town,\" he added. \"But, when it doesn't step up on key issues, countries figure out their own ways of doing it. For example, let's take the last five-10 years, probably the biggest thing that happened in our life was Covid. Now, what did the UN do on Covid? I think the answer is -- not very much,\" the minister said. Jaishankar said, \"Now, you have two conflicts going on in the world today, two very serious conflicts, where is the UN on them, essentially a bystander,\" he said.    113961503So, what is happening, as it did during Covid also, countries did their own thing such as the initiative like Covax that was done by a group of countries, the minister said. \"When it comes to big issues of the day, you have an increasing combination of countries coming together to agree to do something.\" He cited the examples of connectivity initiatives like the India-MiddleEast-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), QUAD in Indo-Pacific to look after the global commons, the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), saying all these bodies came outside the UN framework. \"Today, the UN will continue, but increasingly there is a non-UN space which is the active space and I think it's telling on the UN,\" Jaishankar added. More than 75 years after its inception, the United Nations is still working to maintain international peace and security, give humanitarian assistance to those in need, protect human rights, and uphold international law, according to the UN website. India has been demanding reforms in the world body and its UN Security Council in sync with the changed times. Earlier this year, Jaishankar suggested that the \"short-sighted\" approach of the five permanent members of the UNSC is holding back forward movement in the long-pending reform of the global body. The five permanent members are Russia, the UK, China, France and the US and these countries can veto any substantive resolution. Jaishankar was asked about a possible outcome of the US elections and how will India engage with the new administration.    113960570\"You spoke of one possibility of the two in the American elections. I stress to you, look back over the last five years, how many of the policies which in 2020 people thought were the Trump administration's policies actually not just carried over by Biden but they doubled down on those policies,\" he said. So, this is not just a politician, it's not just a fashion, just one administration. \"I think there are very deep shifts happening,\" the minister added. \"This is... America which actually has made a shift, geopolitically and in its economic outlook and has come to the conclusion that the order which itself devised many years ago no longer works to its benefit to that degree,\" he said. \"So, I would argue, irrespective of the outcomes in November, many of these trends will intensify in the days to come. And, you are going to get, I would call it a more fractured world, but I would say, in some ways, reliability and transparency are going to be two very key factors which will become a metric for countries to have enterprises and domains to have dealings with each other,\" he said. On a question on the Global South, Jaishankar said that it itself has a \"great value\". \"It is a collective. We don't expect to be the leader. We are seen as a trusted member, an articulate member... So, I am not really comfortable with the idea that you walk away from the Global South. On the contrary, I see value,\" the minister said. He also spoke on the role and impact of artificial intelligence in shaping the world going forward.",

        "description": "Mumbai: Robust demand for office spaces has pushed commercial property leasing in the first three quarters of 2019 by 30% from a year ago, taking it closer to entire 2018’s performance and making sure that this year surpasses the peak touched last year.Driven by tech corporates — accounting for about a third of the leasing activity — office space take-up touched 47 million sq ft in the first nine months against entire 2018’s performance of 48.9 million sq ft, showed data from CBRE South Asia. With this, office leasing activity is now expected to touch its highest level ever, estimated to be over 60 million sq ft in 2019.Leasing activity stood at about 15.4 million sq ft during the quarter ended September, rising by nearly 23% on an annual basis. This was dominated by small- to medium-sized transactions. Small-sized transactions of less than 10,000 sq ft accounted for over 40% of the transaction activity in the quarter.\n  \n  \n  \n  71641558\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“With office leasing scaling a historic high in 2019, we expect further strengthening of occupier sentiment in the medium to long term, backed by corporates looking to expand or consolidate their operations. Favourable government initiatives, transparency in the real estate sector and the right reforms will improve investor sentiment greatly in the coming quarters,” said Anshuman Magazine, CEO, India, South-east Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE.Like last year, he expects occupiers would put in greater efforts to incorporate flexibility in their portfolios due to changes in the business environment. Occupiers continued to futureproof their portfolios and hedge against future rental escalations by pre-leasing space across various cities.Bengaluru, followed by Hyderabad, dominated large-sized deal closures, while a few large deals were also reported in the NCR and Pune as well. Large-scale deal closures were mostly dominated by tech firms and flexible space operators. Firms belonging to sectors such as research, consulting &amp; analytics, banking, financial services &amp; insurance (BFSI), and engineering &amp; manufacturing also closed large-sized deals.Tech corporates led the office space take-up, followed by research, consulting &amp; analytics companies (19%) and flexible space operators (15%). The rise in the share of flexible space operators (10% in the second quarter of 2019) was primarily a result of their continued expansion across almost all cities.“The share of the tech sector rose from 31% to 40% annually during 2019 year-to-date, which implies that a rise in technology alternatives, insourcing / job preservation in the US and a global slowdown have not had any specific impact on India’s position as a preferred outsourcing destination for both high-skilled and low-skilled tech services, research and development,” said Ram Chandnani, managing director, advisory &amp; transaction services, India, CBRE South Asia.Supply addition rose by more than 80% in 2019 YTD on an annual basis, with about 43.5 million sq. ft. of development completions reported.Four cities — Hyderabad, Bengaluru, NCR and Mumbai — accounted for almost 80% of this supply addition.Compared to the first three quarters in 2018, the share of SEZs in supply dipped from 40% to 27% during 2019 YTD. Supply addition in the quarter also rose by about 6% on a quarterly basis, touching about 15 million sq. ft. More than 70% of this supply was driven by Hyderabad and NCR, followed by Bengaluru.",

        "description": "MUMBAI: Liquidity risk is increasing for Indian-based real-estate developers, as non-bank financial institutions (NBFI; including housing finance companies) are shying away from lending to the sector, said Fitch Ratings.Developers that rely on refinancing from NBFIs, particularly those with weak financial profiles, will be affected the most should conditions persist. The availability of unencumbered assets among large developers may be of limited use, as NBFIs are looking to shed their already-high exposure to the sector, especially to large borrowers.NBFIs have disproportionately increased their share of real-estate sector credit in the previous few years, owing to heightened risk aversion by banks; banks have been cutting exposure due to their own funding challenges that began in late 2018, which have become more acute in the previous few months; domestic bank exposures fell to 2.3% of loans in the financial year ending March 2019 from 2.8% in 2015-16.NBFIs are now also shying away from refinancing maturing debt of even large, proven developers to limit concentration risk to the sector. This is pushing developers towards alternative funding channels, such as private equity. The availability of such funding could be more limited than the value of maturing debt and may only be available to established developers with sufficient unpledged assets. It would also come at a higher cost. We believe banks may still consider exposure to quality real estate, but overall exposure continues to decline.Developers that are focused on high-end projects may face higher risk, as sales of such projects have slowed in the last two years. We believe these developers would be wary of taking sharp price corrections on unsold inventory to boost sales, except in extreme circumstances, as this could diminish the value of unsold inventory and weaken collateral cover for existing lenders.In addition, any boost in sales would be temporary. Meanwhile, developers with substantial exposure to affordable housing may still benefit from marginal access to lenders in light of healthy pre-sales growth, supported by India's substantial housing deficit and government incentives for buyers via the credit-linked subsidy scheme as well as for developers, including tax deductions and grant of infrastructure status, which entitles companies to some benefits and concessions.The government has announced measures to improve NBFI-sector liquidity, but their efficacy remains to be seen. For example, we believe the government's July 2019 announcement to provide a first-loss guarantee of 10% on securitised assets issued by NBFIs to banks could ease funding pressure for NBFIs in the short term. However, the provision refers only to financially sound issuers and there is a lack of clarity about the duration of the guarantee and the definition of what comprises a 'financially sound' entity. In addition, most of the actions by the authorities to alleviate the liquidity squeeze will benefit the largest and least risky NBFIs and is unlikely to address the pressure on the more property focused players.Defaults by two NBFIs - Infrastructure Leasing &amp; Financial Services Ltd (IL&amp;FS) in September 2018 and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) in June 2019 - have contributed to the sector-wide liquidity squeeze, as investors have become more risk averse. Banks' low appetite for lending to real-estate developers is evidenced by the usually high risk weights attached to such loans. These are due to developers' typically low credit ratings amid high leverage, making exposure to the sector an inefficient use of banks' already-limited capital.Substantial bank recapitalisation to increase lending capacity could benefit NBFIs as well as real-estate developers, subject to the banks' risk appetite. Although a structural improvement in NBFI asset books would take time. Nonetheless, even under better conditions we expect NBFI's to tighten credit standards, with developers facing funding pressure until there is a broader improvement in their operations, with better end-user demand and pricing support.",

        "description": "Adani Green Energy is set to seek board approval to raise Rs 6,150 crore ($750 million) to Rs 8,200 crore ($1 billion) through the qualified institutional placement (QIP) route, said people aware of the matter.Two group companies had got approval of their boards for fundraising on May 13 —Adani Enterprises (Rs 12,500 crore) and Adani Transmission (Rs 8,500 crore).The exercise is part of a group plan outlined internally last year to build a “three-year equity cushion” to support expansion plans.Adani Green has secured such capital-raising permission every year from its board except in 2021, as per a Bloomberg analysis.The capital raised by Adani Green Energy will be used to repay an outstanding $750 million, three-year bond issued in 2021 that’s due next year. The money is likely to be kept in a dedicated redemption reserve account and paid on the due date, said the people cited above.Renegotiating Terms With TotalThe original plan had been to prepay the bond after special Reserve Bank of India (RBI) approval but the company decided against this move.“We do not comment on routine business matters. All public disclosures on business matters are disclosed when appropriate,” an Adani Group spokesperson told ET.Adani Green is also renegotiating the terms of its agreement with French utilities giant TotalEnergies for a proposed $4 billion investment in a green hydrogen venture, having signed a memorandum of understanding in 2022. In February, Total said it was pausing the plan in the wake of the Hindenburg Research report on the Adani Group alleging stock manipulation and fraud. The Adani Group has rejected the report’s findings.Total had said it won’t immediately proceed with the plan that involved taking a 25% stake in Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL), a subsidiary of Adani Enterprises.In June last year, ANIL and TotalEnergies had outlined a capex plan of $50 billion to set up a 2.5 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of green hydrogen manufacturing capacity over the next 10 years, with the first phase of 1 mmtpa expected to be commissioned before 2030. Total had also made a total $10 billion capital commitment to the hydrogen venture, standing guarantor to 50% of the project’s debt, translating to $6 billion, ET had reported February 13.ANIL plans to manufacture green hydrogen and downstream products such as ammonia, urea, methanol and ethanol at its Khavda and Mundra SEZ facilities. The Khavda site has a land bank of 71,000 acres, which has a large-scale renewable deployment potential of 20 GW due to its high wind and solar resource potential.After the initial MoU, a more detailed ‘heads of agreement’ — pre-contractual negotiations for a commercial framework — was originally planned to be signed between May and September this year. But this is unlikely at this juncture.The Adani Group has, however, continued with the project work in Mundra on its own, aiming to complete a substantial part of the first phase of the integrated manufacturing ecosystem for ANIL by December.This involves 4.5 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity and 1.5 GW of wind turbine manufacturing capacity along with electrolysers, glass, aluminium frames etc. Analysts say over 5% of the total capex has already been incurred by Adani though the bulk of the work is scheduled for 2026-2028. Any binding agreement with Total is now expected only in 2024 or 2025 and the valuation and the overall commercial terms is likely to get altered as the French company is not incurring any of the greenfield project risks, they said.“We have 40 GW of land equivalent. We've been doing solar modules for the past five years. We know we will produce modules at 15 cents to 17 cents,” Robbie Singh, chief financial officer of Adani Enterprises, had told ET on January 22.Other than the green hydrogen project, Total has just over $3 billion of investments with Adani, including in gas distribution and solar projects, which it has played down as a small 2.4% slice of its total capital commitments.",

        "description": "Lenders to Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Capital are likely to recover just about ₹10,000 crore after the winning bidder, Hinduja Group, declined to significantly improve its offer in the last round of bilateral negotiations that ended on Monday evening, people aware of the development told ET. The recovery, totalling about ₹10,090 crore on factoring in the target company's cash balances and the Hinduja offer, falls short of the ₹12,500-13,000 crore estimated liquidation value. A Hinduja Group entity, IndusInd International Holdings, offered ₹9,650 crore in the extended auction held on April 26. Hinduja improved the offer by only ₹10 crore during the bilateral negotiations, the people cited above said. In addition, the distressed financial services company has around Rs 430 crore as cash balances, which would be distributed among the lenders. This would add up to Rs 10,090 crore, equating to a 43% recovery for verified lenders.Administrator Nageswara Rao Y has admitted Rs 23,666 crore in claims from verified creditors.\"Hinduja Group will submit a detailed resolution plan by next week while lenders are in the process of finalising distribution of the proceeds,\" one of the persons cited above said. After this, the administrator will invite lenders to vote on the eligible plans.However, resolution of Reliance Capital will be subject to approval from the Supreme Court, which is scheduled to hear in August the auction-related dispute between Torrent Investments, a bidder also in the fray in the earlier rounds.  100459497Crucial LIC, EPFO RolesThe stand by LIC, the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Co on approving the plan will be critical since they are majority debtholders. Yes Bank, an original Reliance Capital lender, sold its debt to JC Flowers ARC. A resolution plan can be approved only if 66% of creditors vote in its favour.Separately, Credit Suisse-led bondholders have decided not to contest a decision by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which directed them to return the custody of Reliance General Insurance shares to the administrator, said the people cited above.This has come as a major relief to the lenders that were worried the resolution might be delayed if Credit Suisse-led bondholders appealed against the tribunal's order.In 2018, Credit Suisse-led investors invested in bonds issued by Reliance Home Finance, a Reliance Capital unit. The home finance company failed to honour the payment on the due date.",

        "description": "Foreign investors turned net sellers in October, offloading shares worth Rs 27,142 crore in just the first three days of October due to intensifying conflict between Israel and Iran, a sharp rise in crude oil prices, and improved performance of Chinese markets. The outflow came after FPI investment reached a nine-month high of Rs 57,724 crore in September. Since June, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have consistently bought equities after withdrawing Rs 34,252 crore in April-May. Overall, FPIs have been net buyers in 2024, except for January, April, and May, data with the depositories showed. Looking ahead, global factors like geopolitical developments and the future direction of interest rates will play a crucial role in determining the flow of foreign investments into the Indian equity markets, Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director, Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, said. According to the data, FPIs made a net withdrawal of Rs 27,142 crore from equities between October 1 and 4, with October 2 being a trading holiday. \"The selling has been mainly triggered by the outperformance of Chinese stocks,\" VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said. The Hang Seng index shot up by 26 per cent per cent in the last one month, and this bullishness is expected to continue since valuations of Chinese stocks are very low and the economy is expected to do well in response to the monetary and fiscal stimulus being implemented by the Chinese authorities, he added. \"Escalating geopolitical tensions, driven by the intensifying conflict between Israel and Iran, a sharp rise in crude oil prices, and the improved performance of the Chinese markets, which currently appear more attractive in terms of valuations, were the primary reasons behind the recent exodus of foreign investments from Indian equities,\" Morningstar's Srivastava said. This, in turn, has contributed to the recent sharp correction in the Indian equity markets. In terms of sector, massive FPIs selling in financials, especially frontline banking stocks, have made their valuations attractive. Long-term domestic investors may utilise this opportunity to buy high-quality banking stocks, Vijayakumar said. In the debt markets, FPIs pulled out 900 crore through the General Limit and invested Rs 190 crore via Voluntary Retention Route (VRR) during the period under review. So far this year, FPIs Invested Rs 73,468 crore in equities and Rs 1.09 lakh lakh crore in the debt market.",

        "title": "Explained: How to interpret Treynor Ratio in mutual funds",
        "link": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/analysis/explained-how-to-interpret-treynor-ratio-in-mutual-funds/articleshow/113982495.cms",
        "description": "Investing in mutual funds involves balancing potential returns with the risks taken to achieve those returns. To evaluate how well a mutual fund performs against the risks incurred, financial metrics like the Treynor ratio are used. This ratio measures the risk-adjusted performance of a fund by focusing on the excess return generated per unit of risk taken, where risk is specifically defined as systematic risk.The Treynor ratio is especially useful for comparing mutual funds within a diversified portfolio, as it accounts for the risk that cannot be eliminated through diversification—also known as market risk or beta.What is the Treynor Ratio?The Treynor ratio measures the returns a mutual fund generates over the risk-free rate in relation to its exposure to systematic risk (beta). It helps investors understand whether a mutual fund is delivering adequate returns for the level of market risk it assumes. A higher Treynor ratio indicates that the mutual fund has been more efficient in generating returns per unit of risk compared to another fund with a lower ratio.The formula for the Treynor ratio is as follows:113982540Where:Actual Return refers to the average return of the mutual fund over a specific period.Risk-Free Rate is the return of a risk-free investment, such as government bonds.Beta measures the sensitivity of the mutual fund to market movements, indicating the fund’s exposure to systematic or market risk.What is Beta and Systematic Risk?Beta is a measure of how much a mutual fund's returns move in relation to the broader market. A beta of 1 means the fund’s performance mirrors the market; a beta greater than 1 indicates the fund is more volatile than the market, while a beta less than 1 suggests it is less volatile than the market.Since beta only considers systematic risk (the risk inherent to the market that cannot be diversified away), the Treynor ratio focuses on how well a fund compensates investors for taking on this market-related risk.How to Interpret the Treynor Ratio?The Treynor ratio helps investors understand whether they are being adequately rewarded for the risk they take on. Here's how to interpret the ratio:Higher Treynor Ratio: A higher Treynor ratio indicates that the fund is generating higher excess returns relative to the market risk it is exposed to. This suggests that the fund manager is effectively managing market risk while delivering good returns.Lower Treynor Ratio: A lower Treynor ratio suggests that the fund is not providing sufficient returns given the level of systematic risk. In such cases, investors may be better off considering other funds or investments with better risk-adjusted performance.Example of the Treynor Ratio:Suppose you’re comparing two mutual funds—Fund A and Fund B. Both have returned 12% over the last year, and the risk-free rate is 4%. However, Fund A has a beta of 1.2, meaning it is more volatile than the market, while Fund B has a beta of 0.8, indicating less volatility.113982645Even though both funds had the same return, Fund B has a higher Treynor ratio because it took on less market risk (beta). This means Fund B provided better risk-adjusted returns than Fund A, making it a more efficient option for an investor looking to maximize returns relative to the amount of risk.Treynor Ratio vs. Sharpe RatioBoth the Treynor ratio and the Sharpe ratio are commonly used to evaluate the risk-adjusted performance of mutual funds, but they differ in how they define risk:Sharpe Ratio: Considers total risk, including both systematic (market) and unsystematic (specific) risk. It uses standard deviation as the risk measure, accounting for all volatility, not just market-related movements.Treynor Ratio: Focuses only on systematic risk (beta), which is associated with the broader market and cannot be diversified away. It ignores unsystematic risk, which can be reduced through diversification.Benefits of Using the Treynor RatioFocus on Market Risk: The Treynor ratio provides a clear picture of how well a mutual fund manages market risk by using beta. This is important for investors who have diversified portfolios and are concerned with a fund's performance relative to the overall market.Simplifies Risk Assessment: By focusing on systematic risk, the Treynor ratio simplifies the relationship between risk and return. It’s easy to interpret for those wanting to know how much return they're receiving for the unavoidable market risks.Useful for Comparing Funds: The Treynor ratio helps investors compare funds with different levels of market volatility, identifying which ones deliver superior risk-adjusted returns.Limitations of the Treynor RatioIgnores Unsystematic Risk: It does not account for unsystematic risk (specific to individual stocks or sectors), which can be important for less-diversified funds.Assumes a Diversified Portfolio: The ratio assumes the portfolio is well-diversified, meaning unsystematic risk has been minimized. If not, it may not fully capture all risks involved.Beta’s Limitations: Beta reflects past market sensitivity and may not predict future volatility. As beta changes over time, the reliability of the Treynor ratio as a risk measure may vary.The Treynor ratio is a valuable tool for assessing the performance of mutual funds in relation to market risk. By focusing on beta, it offers insights into how well a fund generates returns relative to market volatility. However, it should be used alongside other metrics, like the Sharpe ratio, for a complete understanding of a fund’s risk-return profile.",

        "description": "Apple Inc. lost an early round in a discrimination lawsuit brought in the U.S. by a female engineer from India who says her two managers -- one from her country, the other from Pakistan -- treated her as they would in their own countries: as a subservient.The woman’s case in California state court is the latest to allege workplace bias in Silicon Valley that focuses on cultural prejudices of some tech workers from South Asia. Cisco Systems Inc. is fighting a suit brought by California’s civil rights agency alleging bias against a member of India’s so-called lower castes, known as Dalits.Anita Nariani Schulze is part of the Sindhi minority -- she is Hindu, with ancestry in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan. Her complaint alleges that her senior and direct managers, both male, consistently excluded her from meetings while inviting her male counterparts, criticized her, micromanaged her work, and deprived her of bonuses, despite positive performance evaluations and significant team contributions.Schulze claims the managers’ animus reflects sexism, racism, religious bias and discrimination on the basis of national origin. The Sindhi Hindu nationality is “known for its technical acumen” and its gender equality, she says, which “exacerbated the managers’ discriminatory treatment.”In a tentative ruling on Wednesday, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Sunil R. Kulkarni rejected Apple’s request to toss out the suit. While not ruling on the merits of the case, Kulkarni said Schulze had adequately supported her legal claims. Apple had argued her claims weren’t specific enough and were based on stereotypes.But the judge rejected Schulze’s request to represent a class of female Apple employees who suffered job discrimination over the last four years. He agreed with Apple that she didn’t show a pattern of discrimination that could be applied to a broader group.It wasn’t clear from the court’s docket whether the judge will hold a hearing Thursday before issuing a final ruling.Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.In the Cisco case, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleged that two Indian employees at the San Jose-based company discriminated against a Dalit co-worker on the basis of caste.Cisco has denied the claims, insisting it has “zero tolerance for discrimination.” It also said the lawsuit should be tossed out because caste isn’t a protected category under U.S. civil rights law.",

        "description": "Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has introduced a revised variable pay policy that integrates employees' office attendance as a key factor. The updated policy, implemented post the company's quarterly results, establishes four attendance slabs dictating the variable pay for employees.Updated Variable Pay StructureAccording to the new policy, employees working from the office for less than 60% of the time will not receive any variable pay for the quarter. Those with an office attendance between 60-75% will receive 50% of the variable pay, while employees attending the office 75-85% of the time will be eligible for 75% of the variable pay. Only those with office compliance levels above 85% will receive the full variable pay for the quarter.Response to Return-to-Office MandateTCS had earlier announced a return-to-work mandate, with Business unit heads indicating that assigning grades, a prerequisite for promotions, will depend on their track record of working from office.\"Employees' compliance to work from home will be reviewed every quarter. In the event an employee is found to be in violation of the laid down policies, there will be implications on the annual performance review, compensation, and career progression of the employee,\" the policy stated. An email sent to TCS on the updated policy didn't elicit a response till the time of going to press.109504496Disciplinary Action for Non-ComplianceThe policy also cautions that continuous non-compliance with the 85% work from office requirement will lead to disciplinary action. An email sent to TCS regarding the updated policy did not receive a response at the time of publication.CEO's EncouragementIn their communication following the March quarter results, CEO K Krithivasan and CHRO Milind Lakkad emphasized the importance of returning to the office. Krithivasan highlighted the benefits of shared experiences, learning, collaboration, and camaraderie that result from working in a shared physical space.Krithivasan said, \"The last quarter has seen most of you return to the workplace, creating shared experiences, nurturing greater learning, collaboration, and camaraderie.\"“We are still calibrating the total freshers we want to hire for FY25. Our plan is to get to the 40,000 number, but we will see how it goes,” said Milind Lakkad, chief HR officer, TCS.Krithivasan highlighted that almost 65% of TCS associates are now attending the office 3-5 days a week, just a quarter after the policy's implementation, setting TCS apart from its industry peers.He emphasized that the primary objectives behind the \"return to office\" approach are to ensure associates receive the best value and to preserve the \"organizational culture.\"Krithivasan expressed optimism that, with the positive incentives provided, a majority of employees will be back in the office within the next couple of quarters.Industry ComparisonUnlike TCS, other major Indian IT firms such as Infosys and Wipro have not tied variable payouts to the return to office mandate. Wipro has distributed an average variable payout of 85% for the March quarter of FY24, consistent with the 85% variable pay given to junior employees in the Dec quarter.The implementation of TCS's updated variable pay policy underscores the company's stance on the return to office work. The move is intended to motivate employees to return to the office, underscoring the importance of in-person collaboration and organizational culture.In summary, TCS's new policy intertwines variable pay with office attendance, encouraging employees to return to the office for a more collaborative work environment. This initiative aligns with TCS's commitment to maintaining its organizational culture and ensuring optimal performance.(With inputs from TOI)",

        "description": "Chennai: Senior officials of Korean electronics giant Samsung on Sunday called on Tamil Nadu Minister for Industries TRB Rajaa here and discussed swiftly resolving the ongoing labour strike at their factory. The meeting was held following Chief Minister M K Stalin's directive to three of his ministers to resolve the issue at the earliest. Nearly 1,100 employees of the total 1,750 are on strike at the factory in Sriperumbudur near here, since September 9 pressing for various demands including pay revision and better working conditions. They also demand that the Samsung India Workers' Union backed by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) gets registered by the state government. Stalin on Saturday instructed three state ministers, including Rajaa, T M Anbarasan (MSME) and C V Ganesan (Labour Welfare and Skill Development) to hold talks with the management and the employees and ensure an early end to the strike. \"On the advice of Chief Minister M K Stalin, I met the Samsung's management today and had discussions on swiftly resolving contentious issues. The chief minister has also directed the Minister for MSME T M Anbarasan and myself to join the efforts of the Minister of Labour C V Ganesan to ensure a quick and positive resolution,\" Rajaa said in a social media post on Sunday. \"We are confident that Samsung's management and their employees will come together and arrive at an amicable solution that benefits everyone involved,\" Rajaa added. Scores of cadres of Left parties including their state leaders were detained on October 5 when they held a demonstration without police permission, to express solidarity with the agitating workers near the factory. Responding to the strike, Samsung India said it was committed to resolving the issues including wages, benefits and working conditions by negotiating with the workers directly. Samsung produces consumer durables at the plant, including refrigerators, washing machines and televisions. \"At Samsung India, the welfare of our employees is our top priority. We want to reiterate that we comply with all laws and regulations of the country,\" the company spokesperson said. \"We are committed to resolving all issues including wages, benefits and working conditions by negotiating with our workers directly. As of now, we have been able to normalise production at our Chennai factory. We have ensured that there is no disruption to our consumers ahead of the festive season. We again urge the striking workers to return to work,\" the spokesperson added.",

        "description": "Common wisdom about generative AI is that it will displace lots of professional jobs. The more nuanced take: It’ll take lots of entry-level jobs.I’ve asked several businesses over the last few months how they’re using newfangled generative AI models from the likes of Microsoft Corp., OpenAI and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and a common theme is automating grunt work — the kind you’d give to a new recruit, like conducting market research or writing reports. That might make sense on the surface, but as with every technology revolution there will be a price, one that both businesses and graduates will have to pay as AI raises the bar to starting a career.One example of the trend comes from Man Group Plc. The British hedge fund has been using a large-language model to synthesize lots of unstructured market data from external sources into pithy paragraphs that are presented to its portfolio managers. That work is normally carried out manually by junior analysts. “Now they can work on higher-value stuff,” says Tim Mace, the firm’s managing director of data and machine learning. Much the same is happening at some of Wall Street’s biggest banks, who have been experimenting with AI tools that can instantly answer questions about publicly traded companies or generate reports and one-page presentations, work typically done by analysts who’ve just stepped onto the bottom rung of the investment-banking ladder. Top executives at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and other banks have been debating how deep they can cut those incoming analyst classes, The New York Times reported in April.A survey this year by the UK’s Institute for Public Policy Research found that low-ranking office work has a 16% higher chance of being taken over by AI compared to jobs for more senior workers. “For a given job, entry-level positions are more at risk than those of more experienced professionals,” the report said. Little wonder that a frequent piece of advice for adopting ChatGPT is to treat it “like an intern.”What happens when businesses automate entry-level roles? One outcome is lower costs, but there might be a tradeoff. Grunt work can be a valuable route to learning the tricks of the trade and building the intuition needed in a more senior role. Sure, it can be tedious for a junior analyst at an investment bank to build an Excel spreadsheet with 20 tabs about a stock, or a 50-page slide deck about a potential deal, but the process can also help them develop a better sense for valuing companies. What’s seen as a hazing ritual in some industries, and low-value work, can be useful in training the next generation of senior managers.114001029It also poses an uncomfortable challenge for college grads targeting professions like law and banking in the coming years. The New York Times goes as far as to say that investment banks will “nullify the need to hire thousands of new college graduates.” If future employers expect their young recruits to do higher-level work, those grads will need to show they have those higher-level skills. Over the next one or two decades, that might even lead to a rethink of how higher-education prepares young people to enter a workforce where they are no longer doing the job of interns but managing machines that are interns instead. Technology has of course been streamlining entry-level tasks throughout history, taking us from abacuses to calculators, typewriters to word processors, and library stacks to smartphone databases. But generative AI represents a bigger leap: It's not only automating routine tasks but mimicking human creativity and decision-making, threatening to erase entire categories of junior positions and shutting established entry points to professional careers.Businesses should be mindful of how they define “low-value” work that’s suddenly ripe for automation. It might be more valuable than they think.",

        "description": "Indian market is likely to trade higher on Monday tracking positive global cues.The Indian equity markets concluded their fifth consecutive session in the red on October 4, with the Nifty closing around 25,000, down by 235.50 points or 0.93%.From its recent life-highs, the Nifty has corrected nearly 1,300 points, which represents a 5% drop.The Nifty index has broken below both the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMA), closing beneath these key short-term indicators, data showed.“This breakdown signals a strong bearish momentum likely to continue into the upcoming week. On the weekly chart, Nifty has formed a significant bearish candlestick pattern, further supporting the possibility of sustained downward pressure,” Mandar Bhojane, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Broking, said.“If the index breaches and sustains below the 25,000 level, there is potential for further correction toward the 100-day EMA, which is positioned around the 24,375 level,” he said.“In the near term, 24,800 will act as a critical support zone, while a failure to hold above this level may intensify the selling pressure. The current technical trend suggests a sell on rise strategy, with fresh buying opportunities likelyto emerge only if the Nifty decisively moves above the 25,500 zone,” recommended Bhojane.We have collated a list of stocks from the F&amp;O basket along with cash market from various experts for traders who have a short-term trading horizon:Expert: Sagar Doshi, Technical Analyst Research at Nuvama Wealth told ETBureauTech Mahindra: Buy| Target Rs 1762| Stop Loss Rs 1565APL Apollo: Buy| Target Rs 1755| Stop Loss Rs 1560Expert: Kunal Bothra, Market Expert told ETNowBalrampur Chini Mills: Buy| Target Rs 690| Stop Loss Rs 650Alkem Laboratories: Buy| Target Rs 6325| Stop Loss Rs 6150VIP Industries: Buy| Target Rs 588| Stop Loss Rs 550Expert: Nooresh Merani, an independent technical analyst told ETNowBank of Baroda: Buy| Target Rs 265| Stop Loss Rs 245Tata Chemicals: Buy| Target Rs 1250| Stop Loss Rs 1100VIP Industries: Buy| Target Rs 650| Stop Loss Rs 535(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own.

Considering the potential risk of a Jammed or Restricted Rudder control system, the DGCA has issued the following Interim safety recommendations to all Indian operators of Boeing 737 aircraft, effective immediately:1. Issuance of circular/advisory: All flight crews are to be informed through a circular/advisory regarding the possibility of a Jammed or restricted Rudder control system. Appropriate mitigations must be communicated to help crews identify and handle such a situation.2. Safety risk assessment: All operators must conduct a Safety Risk Assessment for aircraft to evaluate and mitigate the risk associated with the Rudder control system.3. Discontinue CAT III B approach and rollout operations: All Category III B approach, landing, and rollout operations (including practice or actual autoland) must be discontinued for airplanes until further notice.4. Mandatory training discussions: Discussion about potential Rudder control system issues must be included as a mandatory topic in Recurrent Training sessions and Instrument Rating/Proficiency Checks (IR/PPC) during Pre-Simulator Briefings.5. Recurrent training exercises: Operators have been instructed to include specific exercises in Recurrent Training and IR/PPC that simulate scenarios involving a Jammed or Restricted Rudder control system, including rollout procedures. Appropriate flight crew responses and mitigations should be practiced during these exercises.\"These interim measures aim to enhance safety and ensure that flight crews are well-prepared to handle potential Rudder control issues effectively, pending further detailed operational guidance to be issued by Boeing/FAA,\" DGCA statement said.(With TOI inputs)",

        "description": "Shares of Ola Electric Mobility fell 9.4% to Rs 89.7 in Monday's intraday trade on the BSE, following a heated exchange between the company's founder and CEO, Bhavish Aggarwal, and comedian Kunal Kamra on X (formerly Twitter). The confrontation centered around the service issues of Ola Electric's scooters.The verbal confrontation was sparked by Kamra's post featuring an image of an Ola dealership, which showed a large number of Ola scooters parked outside, gathering dust.&amp;mdash; kunalkamra88 (@kunalkamra88) Kamra's post didn't stop there; he tagged the Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari, questioning him, “Is this how Indians will get to using EVs?” Additionally, he included the Department of Consumer Affairs in his post, asking for their input, “Any word?” Kamra also invited those who experienced issues with Ola Electric to share their stories in the comments.In response, Aggarwal accused Kamra of posting a “paid tweet,” stating, “Since you care so much @kunalkamra88, come and help us out! I’ll even pay more than you earned for this paid tweet or from your failed comedy career.” He added, “Or else sit quiet and let us focus on fixing the issues for the real customers.” Aggarwal further claimed, “We’re expanding service network fast and backlogs will be cleared soon.”&amp;mdash; bhash (@bhash) However, many users criticized Aggarwal's tone, calling it “arrogant.” One commenter noted, “Focus on customer service, take feedback in the right spirit, and work on improving your product if you want to stay in the game long term.”Another user highlighted the struggles of middle-class consumers, stating, “Imagine a middle-class person saving 3-4 months of salary to buy an OLA, only for it to have problems in the first week and then park at your service center for days.”Following the decline in today's share prices, social media influencer and YouTuber Akash Banerjee (also known as Bhakt Banerjee) targeted Aggarwal on X, writing, \"Chot lagi? Dard hua? Ja service center. Bahut kaam hai. If you do not fix the problem of broken Ola scooters @bhash, then your stock will be a bigger flop than @kunalkamra88's shows. Show your customers how much you truly care and whether you’re only gas and BS.\"&amp;mdash; TheDeshBhakt (@TheDeshBhakt) This exchange highlights not only the service challenges faced by Ola Electric but also broader issues within the electric vehicle (EV) industry concerning customer satisfaction and corporate responsibility. As more consumers transition to electric scooters, companies like Ola must prioritize effective communication and responsive service to maintain trust and loyalty among their customer base.Meanwhile, Ola Electric shares are under significant pressure, having declined 43% from their all-time high of Rs 157.5. However, they remain 18% above their IPO listing price of Rs 76.In Q1 FY25, Ola Electric reported a 32% increase in revenue to Rs 1,644 crore, while its net loss widened to Rs 347 crore, compared to a loss of Rs 267 crore in the same period last year.",

        "description": "The shares of Titan fell nearly 3% to Rs 3,562 on the BSE despite a strong Q2 business update. The jewelry maker registered standalone growth of 25% year-on-year for the second quarter ended September 2025. A total of 75 stores (net) were added during the quarter, expanding Titan's combined retail network to 3,171 stores. Domestic jewellery operations grew 25% YoY in Q2 after a relatively soft Q1.Consumer demand significantly picked up momentum following the reduction in customs duty on gold imports from 15% to 6%, leading to a strong double-digit increase in plain gold sales for the quarter, the company said.Here's what brokerages said to ETNow:Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley maintains an equal-weight rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 3,570. According to the brokerage, there is an 80% probability that the share price will rise in the next 15 days. The jewellery segment's revenue is expected to grow 16% year-on-year, driven by increased demand in July following the duty cut. This growth also reflects the high base effect from the delayed Pitru Paksh last October, which contributed to a significant improvement in overall growth.MacquarieMacquarie maintains an outperform rating with a target price of Rs 4,100. The brokerage noted healthy commentary on jewellery sales ahead of the Q2 update, with pre-Q2 sales surpassing estimates. Better-than-expected jewellery sales and strong growth in watches offset weaknesses in the eyewear and other segments. Macquarie expects 9% standalone EBITDA growth in Q2.InvestecInvestec maintains a hold rating with a target price of Rs 4,100. While a strong revenue print is expected, PAT growth is likely to be muted. The jewellery segment is experiencing good growth, but a weak studded mix could impact margins. The watches and wearables sector shows strong growth in analog sales, while the eyewear segment continues to lag behind the overall company growth. In the emerging business segment, double-digit growth is anticipated across various sectors.The non-solitaire studded segment recorded high double-digit growth, while the solitaire segment experienced a decline due to price uncertainty and demand-supply dynamics in international markets. This resulted in overall studded sales growth in low double digits for the quarter.The launch of new collections, promotions, and various marketing campaigns drove buyer growth of 11% year-on-year. Like-to-like (secondary) sales growth for domestic operations came in the mid-teens.Of the 23 new store additions (net) in India, 11 were in Tanishq, 11 in Mia, and 1 in Zoya. The watches and wearables domestic business grew 19% year-on-year, with revenue growth in analog around 25% year-on-year, supported by both volume and value increases.Titan Eye+ saw a 6% YoY increase in its domestic business, with secondary sales growth nearly matching this figure and buyer growth rising marginally higher YoY. The brand added 2 new stores (net) in India during the quarter. Revenue in the fragrances and fashion accessories segments jumped 17% year-on-year, with fragrances growing by 19% and fashion accessories rising by 11%.",

        "description": "The government has started selling tomatoes through mobile vans at Rs 65 per kilogram to contain the price of the kitchen essential through retail outlets of the National Cooperative Consumers’ Federation of India (NCCF), NAFED and Safal in Delhi and neighbouring cities.Tomato prices have skyrocketed, with the vegetable now selling at over Rs 100 per kg in several markets as unseasonal rains damaged the tomato crop in key farming areas in Maharashtra.The modal price - a type of average price calculated by the government - of tomatoes increased 39% in October compared to the previous month to Rs 62 per kg from Rs 44 per kg last month in the retail market and to Rs 5045 per quintal from Rs 3562 per quintal in the whole sale market, according to government data.According to a recent report by rating agency Crisil, the cost of home cooked vegetarian thali surged 11% year-on-year in September mainly on account of high vegetable prices.The centre has launched this market intervention under the price stabilisation fund to manage rising tomato prices in the retail market. In July, food minister Pralhad Joshi initiated a similar move, selling tomatoes at Rs 60/kg to control price hikes.Traders and farmers said that sowing for kharif tomato is lagging behind in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh compared to the previous year. The intensity of pests and diseases in tomatoes have also been reported to be above the economic threshold level in Maharashtra, causing a dip in supply.Vegetable prices usually increase during the monsoon season as rainfall affects harvesting, including plucking and packaging. Additionally, transport disruptions lead to increased vegetable wastage, further impacting prices. This year, severe heat wave also damaged crops in the main producing areas.",

        "description": "Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty extended their losing streak for the sixth straight session and settled sharply lower on Monday dragged down by heavy selling in bellwether stocks amid mixed global trends.Stocks that were in focus include names like Macrotech Developers, which gained 1.3%, Naukri, which declined 2.4%, and Titan, whose shares were down 2.6% on Monday.Here's what Ameya Ranadive CMT CFTe, Sr Technical Analyst at StoxBox, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today.Macrotech DevelopersMacrotech Developers is currently trading at Rs 1,190, facing downward pressure as it struggles to hold its 20, 50, and 100-day exponential moving averages (EMAs). However, the stock is taking support at the 200-day EMA, a key indicator of long-term trend strength.The most critical support level lies between Rs 1,150 and Rs 1,090, and with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) bouncing from oversold territory at 38, this presents an appealing risk-reward scenario. If the stock sustains above the Rs 1,155 mark, a potential rebound could take it towards targets of Rs 1,415 to Rs 1,450.Despite recent weakness, the stock remains in a position where any technical bounce could offer a good opportunity for short-term traders and investors. However, caution is warranted if LODHA breaks below the crucial support at Rs 1,150, it could signal further downside.Investors are advised to watch the stock closely for signs of a reversal at these levelsNaukriNaukri (Info Edge) is currently trading at Rs 7,960, continuing its robust performance despite market volatility. Over the past year, the stock has delivered over 140% returns from its 2023 lows, making it a standout performer.Even as the broader market faces profit-booking pressure, Naukri has consistently hit new all-time highs, underscoring its strength. The stock is trading comfortably above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs, which points to a healthy uptrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at a steady 55, and the Average Directional Index (ADX) reads 27, indicating that bullish momentum is intact.Given its solid technical structure, Naukri is an ideal buy-on-dips candidate. Investors can expect further gains, with potential upside targets ranging from Rs 8,250 to Rs 8,500. For those seeking long-term growth, the stock's resilience in challenging market conditions presents a compelling opportunity. Any pullbacks toward key support levels could be used as entry points for further accumulation.TitanTitan is currently trading at Rs 3,586, at a crucial support zone between Rs 3,550 and Rs 3,500, an area that previously acted as resistance. This support zone, along with the 100 and 200-day EMAs, suggests that the stock is at a key inflection point.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 39, indicating that the stock is nearing oversold territory, which could trigger a technical rebound. Given the stock's ability to hold these critical support levels, Titan offers a favorable risk-reward opportunity for traders and investors.A bounce from this support zone could propel the stock towards targets of Rs 3,900 to Rs 4,000, offering an upside potential of 9-12%. Titan has shown strength in maintaining long-term trend support, and this level could attract buying interest for those looking for a short-term gain. Investors are advised to watch for confirmation of the rebound before entering new positions, as a failure to hold support could lead to further downside.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "description": "The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) has turned to investigating whether arrangements between Amazon and Flipkart, and their vendors, violated foreign direct investment (FDI) norms, said people aware of the matter. The investigation had earlier focused on the sellers.The aim is to find out if the ecommerce companies were exercising control over vendors. Under the rules, they can only act as platforms.ED is investigating alleged violations under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema) that are ordinarily civil offences entailing monetary penalties. Earlier this month, the agency conducted nationwide searches at 19 sites related to large sellers on Amazon and Flipkart in New Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.“The sellers covered during the searches were summoned and have been questioned to explain certain transactions and arrangements. Documents are being studied thoroughly,” said an official with knowledge of the matter. “The main focus is to ascertain whether Amazon and Flipkart operated through a preferred set of sellers, which were invariably controlled by them but disguised as independent vendors, thus violating FDI norms.”115392764“Once all search-related documents are studied and people linked to them are questioned, key managerial personnel—who handle FDI of the company—will be asked to join the probe,” said the official cited above.Actionable materialWhile the sellers were covered in the first leg, the next one will be concentrated on the ecommerce giants, those in the know said. The issue dates from 2019, said a person linked to one of the companies.Amazon India and Flipkart did not respond to ET’s queries. The central probe agency hasn’t summoned them.The issue has been under investigation for the past few years, said the people cited. However, fresh searches were conducted earlier this month after the agency found certain actionable material, according to them.“The issue has been active and, in the past, the companies were asked to join the investigation (and) they had explained their stand,” another person familiar with the probe told ET. “However, there was fresh material, which led to the recent searches.”ED wants to discover whether the platforms played a role in influencing prices and if the sellers breached the 25% sales limit. “ED has collected enough material to ask the companies to explain their side,” one of the persons said.Executives denied any wrongdoing and repeated to ET that they had explained their stand to the authorities before. “FDI norms are very stringent and now, with most of the transactions having a digital footprint, it is impossible to violate them,” said one of them.Any violation will bring scrutiny by multiple law enforcement agencies, something that companies are averse to, given the reputational risk, said another person, adding that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the FDI gatekeeper, so the scrutiny is rigorous.“Both companies were summoned in the past,” said the executive. “The same set of queries (have been) made by CCI (the Competition Commission of India) and ED, and the companies have explained their stand methodically and meticulously.”India’s FDI rules prohibit ecommerce companies with foreign investment from operating on an inventory-based model. In December 2018, the Centre notified a new set of rules for ecommerce companies, disallowing them from directly or indirectly holding any stake in sellers or having any sway over them. The rules also mandated that no one seller should contribute to more than 25% of the sales of a single platform. Following the tightening of the norms, the two companies have either shut or divested stakes in major sellers listed on their platforms.ET reported in April that Clicktech, a major seller on Amazon India, was acquiring peer Appario Retail as a part of the ecommerce firm’s plan to divest stakes in sellers on its platform. Appario, the largest seller on Amazon India following the closure of Cloudtail, moved a significant volume of orders for the local arm of the US-based etailer. The sale of the stake to Clicktech was the second time Amazon divested its stake from a seller to comply with India’s ecommerce norms.Separately, the marketplaces’ alleged preferences for a small number of large sellers has also been investigated by CCI to ascertain whether they have been providing a level-playing field to all. “The ED probe, however, is different from the CCI action,” said one of the people cited. “It is based on complaints received by ED over alleged violations of foreign investment rules.”",

        "description": "Shares of Mahanagar Gas and Indraprastha Gas fell up to 18% on Monday after the government cut the Administered Price Mechanism (APM) allocation to city gas distribution firms by 20% for the second consecutive month. Mahanagar Gas shares dropped to Rs 1,075, while Indraprastha Gas shares slid to Rs 324.8.The brokerage slashed its target price for MGL by 35% to Rs 1,164 and for IGL by 31% to Rs 373, reflecting downward revisions in EBITDA estimates, concerns about slower volume growth, and expectations of narrower profit margins in the coming years.For IGL, EBITDA per standard cubic meter (scm) has been slashed by 26.4% for FY25, with the long-term EBITDA average revised down from Rs 8.1/scm to Rs 6.5/scm. MGL faces similar challenges, with its long-term average EBITDA/scm reduced to Rs 10.42, reflecting a 16% decline.Also Read: HAL shares rally 4% after Q2 PAT jumps 22% YoY to Rs 1,510 crore The sudden and successive cuts in APM gas allocation have disrupted the CGD sector, which had gradually adapted to previous allocation reductions, bringing it from 94% to under 70%. However, the accelerated pace of these cuts has caught companies off guard, forcing them to rely more heavily on expensive LNG to meet demand.The additional costs are expected to lead to significant CNG price hikes, which could erode consumer affordability and further compress margins. Nirmal Bang estimates that EBITDA growth for both companies will remain under pressure through FY27, with limited scope for operational recovery in the near term.While the government has shown support for CNG as a cleaner fuel alternative, policy actions have been somewhat inconsistent. The brokerage suggests that relief measures, such as excise duty cuts, could partially offset the financial burden. A reduction of 5-6% in excise duties could lower CNG prices by Rs 3-4 per kilogram, providing some relief to consumers and aiding volume recovery. However, the lack of a clear long-term policy framework continues to weigh heavily on investor sentiment.Also Read: Zinka Logistics IPO Day 3: GMP, price band, subscription, key dates and reviewFinancial forecasts for the companies suggest a challenging outlook. For FY25, IGL’s revenue is projected to grow by 9%, but PAT is expected to decline by 26%, with EBITDA margins revised down to 11%. MGL is likely to see a 7.5% increase in revenue, but PAT is forecasted to drop by 21%, with EBITDA margins reduced to 22% from the earlier estimate of 24%.The broader CGD sector is facing rising costs, regulatory uncertainties, and competitive pressures. While positive developments, such as price adjustments or tax reliefs, could prompt short-term rallies, the overall outlook remains uncertain. Investors are likely to remain cautious until the sector demonstrates clear signs of operational recovery and policy stability.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "description": "Mumbai: Over 12 lakh gig or freelance roles were posted during the 2024 festive season, which is 23 per cent more than last year driven by the rise of e-commerce, tech advancements, and the transition to flexible, on-demand roles post-pandemic, a report said on Tuesday.  This demand is primarily driven by a booming retail environment, evolving customer expectations, increased consumer spending, the expansion of e-commerce, and the growing trend of 'just-in-time' hiring, said the report.  \"This festive season, over 1.2 million gig roles were posted. We're seeing more than just a spike in gig roles - it's a transformation in how people and companies are approaching work,\" end-to-end recruitment solutions provider Avsar founder and CEO Navneet Singh said quoting its report - 'Gig Workers Report'.  The report is based on an analysis of data collected from Avsar's platform, covering key sectors such as logistics, retail, e-commerce, and customer support, with a focus on geographic demand shifts between metro and tier II cities.  Tier II cities like Surat, Jaipur, and Lucknow are rapidly becoming key hubs for gig hiring, showing a strong demand, while metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi NCR, and Bengaluru still lead in overall numbers, accounting for 53 per cent of the demand, it said.  The shift toward tier II cities highlights the expanding reach of the gig economy beyond traditional urban areas, added the report.  According to the report to attract talent in a competitive market, companies are offering higher pay for gig roles this season.  Field technicians can earn up to Rs 35,000 monthly, while customer support executives and delivery personnel earn between Rs 18,000 and Rs 28,000.  This rise in pay reflects a combination of factors, including a shortage of skilled workers in high-demand roles and the need for businesses to meet rising service expectations during the festive season, making gig work more appealing for skilled professionals, it said.  Logistics, retail, and customer support roles dominate this season's demand, it said.  Logistics roles account for 35 per cent of all gig jobs, followed by retail and e-commerce at 28 per cent, and customer support at 15 per cent.  \"It's exciting to see gig work becoming a viable, long-term career path for many, with roles that also reflect growing values around sustainability. We believe the gig economy is evolving into something lasting and impactful for India's workforce,\" Singh added.",
